PrettyTweets
============

A TTYtter extension which reformats the tweets to look pretty.

PrettyTweets.pl
---------------

The extension.  Simply load it adding -exts="/path/to/PrettyTweets.pl" to your
ttytter invocation.

NOTE
----

I have not tested this code with anything but my own setup.  If you *do* run it
and encounter problems, I'd love to hear about it.
